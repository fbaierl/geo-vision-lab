# Python Clean Architecture

Provide Clean Architecture guidance for Python projects, specifically FastAPI APIs. Based on seven core design principles, Pythonic implementations of classic patterns, and a three-layer architecture (Routers → Operations → Database).

> **Attribution:** The principles, patterns, and architectural approach in this skill are inspired by and synthesized from [Arjan Codes](https://www.arjancodes.com/)' courses: *The Software Designer Mindset*, *Pythonic Patterns*, and *Complete Extension*. The specific Pythonic framing (Protocol-based DI, functional pattern progression, three-layer FastAPI architecture) originates from his teaching. This plugin distills those principles into actionable guidance for Claude Code — it is not a reproduction of course content. See also: [github.com/arjancodes](https://github.com/arjancodes) | [youtube.com/arjancodes](https://www.youtube.com/arjancodes).

## When to Apply

- Scaffolding new FastAPI projects with clean separation of concerns
- Refactoring existing Python code to reduce coupling and increase cohesion
- Adding new components (endpoints, operations, repositories, models)
- Reviewing code for design quality and Pythonic idiom adherence
- Making code testable through dependency injection and Protocol-based abstractions

## Core Architecture: Three Layers

Every FastAPI project follows a strict three-layer dependency flow:

```
Routers (API layer)  →  Operations (business logic)  →  Database (persistence)
```

Each layer depends ONLY on the layer below it. Never skip layers.

### Layer Responsibilities

**Routers** — HTTP interface. Accept requests, call operations, return responses. No business logic. Act as the composition root where concrete implementations are injected.

**Operations** — Business logic. Accept a `DataInterface` (Protocol) parameter for data access. Compute derived values, enforce rules, orchestrate workflows. Never import database modules directly.

**Database** — Persistence. Implement the `DataInterface` Protocol using SQLAlchemy, file storage, or any backend. Expose `read_by_id`, `read_all`, `create`, `update`, `delete` methods. Return `DataObject = dict[str, Any]` to decouple from ORM models.

### The DataInterface Protocol

```python
from typing import Any, Protocol

DataObject = dict[str, Any]

class DataInterface(Protocol):
    def read_by_id(self, id: str) -> DataObject: ...
    def read_all(self) -> list[DataObject]: ...
    def create(self, data: DataObject) -> DataObject: ...
    def update(self, id: str, data: DataObject) -> DataObject: ...
    def delete(self, id: str) -> None: ...
```

Operations accept `data_interface: DataInterface` as a parameter. The router passes the concrete implementation. This is dependency injection — no ABC inheritance needed.

### Pydantic Models

Define separate Create and Read models per entity:

```python
class CustomerCreate(BaseModel):
    name: str
    email: str

class Customer(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    email: str
```

Use `**data.model_dump()` to unpack Pydantic models into DataObject dicts. Use `exclude_none=True` on update models for partial updates.

## Seven Design Principles

When writing or reviewing code, apply these principles in order of priority:

1. **High Cohesion** — Each class/function has a single responsibility. Extract class when a class does two things. Extract function when a function does two things.
2. **Low Coupling** — Minimize dependencies. Move methods to the class that owns the data (Information Expert). Pass only what a function needs.
3. **Depend on Abstractions** — Use `Protocol` for structural typing and `Callable` type aliases for function injection. Patterns emerge from good abstraction.
4. **Composition over Inheritance** — Extract shared behavior into standalone classes with a Protocol interface. Use `list[PaymentSource]` patterns. Never use mixins.
5. **Separate Creation from Use** — One composition root (the router or main function). Dictionary mapping over if/elif chains. Creator functions for complex construction.
6. **Start with the Data** — Fix data structures first; methods and layers follow. Extract domain classes from prefixed fields. Eliminate parallel lists.
7. **Keep Things Simple** — DRY (but avoid hasty abstractions). KISS (simplest design that works). YAGNI (implement only what is needed now).

## Pythonic Pattern Selection

When encountering these code smells, apply the corresponding pattern:

| Code Smell | Pattern | Pythonic Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Long if/elif switching behavior | Strategy | `Callable` type alias, pass functions as args |
| Need to create objects from config/JSON | Registry | `dict[str, Callable]` mapping + `**kwargs` unpacking |
| Event/notification side effects mixed with core logic | Notification (Pub/Sub) | `subscribe(event, handler)` / `post_event(event, data)` dict-based |
| Duplicated algorithm across classes | Template Method | Extract to free function + Protocol parameter |
| Two independent hierarchies that vary | Bridge | `Callable` type alias replaces abstract reference |
| Need undo/batch/queue operations | Command | Functions returning undo closures |
| Object creation coupled to usage | Abstract Factory | Tuples of functions + `functools.partial` |
| Sequential data transformations | Pipeline | `functools.reduce` for composition, or framework `.pipe()` |
| Need to react to events without coupling | Callback | Function passed as argument, called when event occurs |
| Reusing a function with a different interface | Function Wrapper | Calls another function, translates its arguments |
| Separating configuration from usage | Function Builder | Higher-order function returns a configured function |
| Bare primitives for domain concepts (prices, emails) | Value Objects | Subclass built-in types with `__new__` validation, or frozen dataclass |
| Need audit trail, temporal queries, or event replay | Event Sourcing | Immutable `Event[T]`, append-only `EventStore[T]`, projection functions |
| Read/write patterns diverge; list views compute derived fields | CQRS | Separate write model + read projection, projector function after writes |
| Complex object with many optional parts | Builder | Fluent API with `Self` return type, `.build()` returns frozen product |
| Multiple DB writes that must succeed or fail together | Unit of Work | Context manager wrapping transaction: commit on success, rollback on error |
| Need exactly one instance of a shared resource | Singleton | Module-level instance (preferred), or metaclass with `_instances` dict |
| Object behaves differently depending on internal state | State | Protocol-based state objects, context delegates to current state |
| Incompatible interface from external library | Adapter | Protocol interface + `functools.partial` for single-method adaptation |
| Client coupled to complex subsystem details | Facade | Simplified interface class, `functools.partial` to bind dependencies |
| Transient failures in external API/DB calls | Retry | `@retry` decorator with exponential backoff, fallback strategies |
| Slow startup loading unused resources | Lazy Loading | `functools.cache`, TTL cache, generators, background preloading |
| Data access logic mixed into domain classes | Repository | Protocol interface for CRUD, concrete implementations per backend |
| Sequential operations on an object are verbose and error-prone | Fluent Interface | Methods return `self` for chaining, domain-specific verbs |
| Need extensibility without modifying core code | Plugin Architecture | Config-driven creation, `importlib` auto-discovery, self-registering modules |

### Default preferences for all patterns:

- **Protocol over ABC** — unless shared state in the superclass is needed
- **`functools.partial`** — to configure generic functions rather than creating wrapper classes
- **Closures** — to separate configuration-time args from runtime args
- **Don't go full functional** — find the happy medium; readability is the ultimate arbiter

## Scaffolding a New Project

When asked to create a new FastAPI project, generate this structure:

```
project_name/
├── main.py                    # FastAPI app, include_router, lifespan handler
├── routers/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── {entity}.py            # APIRouter, endpoint functions
├── operations/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── interface.py           # DataInterface Protocol + DataInterfaceStub
│   └── {entity}.py            # Business logic functions
├── db/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── database.py            # Engine, SessionLocal, Base
│   ├── db_interface.py        # Generic DBInterface class
│   └── models.py              # SQLAlchemy models
├── models/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── {entity}.py            # Pydantic Create/Read models
├── tests/
│   └── test_{entity}.py       # Tests using DataInterfaceStub
├── requirements.txt
└── .gitignore
```

## Testing Strategy

Create a `DataInterfaceStub` base class that stores data in a plain dict. Override specific methods in test-specific subclasses. Pass the stub to operations functions — no database needed.

```python
from typing import Any

DataObject = dict[str, Any]

class DataInterfaceStub:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data: dict[str, DataObject] = {}
    def read_by_id(self, id: str) -> DataObject:
        if id not in self.data:
            raise KeyError(f"Not found: {id}")
        return self.data[id]
    def read_all(self) -> list[DataObject]:
        return list(self.data.values())
    def create(self, data: DataObject) -> DataObject:
        self.data[data["id"]] = data
        return data
    def update(self, id: str, data: DataObject) -> DataObject:
        if id not in self.data:
            raise KeyError(f"Not found: {id}")
        self.data[id].update(data)
        return self.data[id]
    def delete(self, id: str) -> None:
        if id not in self.data:
            raise KeyError(f"Not found: {id}")
        del self.data[id]
```

#### Intentional Upgrades from Source Transcript

The example code applies the same architectural principles taught in the Arjan Codes course but modernizes several implementation details. Each file documents its specific upgrades in its module docstring. Summary of deliberate changes:

| Category | Transcript (original) | Example (upgraded) | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **IDs** | Integer, autoincrement | String UUID (`uuid.uuid4()`) | App-generated, portable across databases |
| **SQLAlchemy** | Legacy 1.x (`declarative_base()`, `session.query()`) | 2.0 style (`DeclarativeBase`, `session.get()`, `select()`) | Current best practice, forward-compatible |
| **Pydantic models** | `@dataclass` + raw dicts | `BaseModel` with Create/Update/Read variants | FastAPI native, automatic validation & serialization |
| **Startup** | `@app.on_event("startup")` | `lifespan` context manager | `on_event` is deprecated in modern FastAPI |
| **Test framework** | `unittest.TestCase` | `pytest` functions | Simpler, more Pythonic, industry standard |
| **Stub pattern** | `NotImplementedError` base, subclass per test | Full in-memory dict implementation | Directly usable without boilerplate subclasses |
| **Error handling** | None (silent None returns) | `KeyError` + `HTTPException(404)` | Production-ready error responses |
| **Router config** | Bare `APIRouter()` | `prefix=`, `tags=`, `response_model`, status codes | OpenAPI docs, proper HTTP semantics |
| **Customer model** | `first_name`/`last_name`/`email_address` | `name`/`email` | Simplified for example clarity |
| **Table names** | Singular (`"room"`) | Plural (`"rooms"`) | SQL naming convention |
| **Session mgmt** | Global `db_session` in DBInterface | Injected via constructor parameter | Better dependency injection |
| **Package** | `hotel.*` top-level package | Flat imports | Standalone example clarity |

The core architecture (three-layer separation, `DataInterface` Protocol, dependency injection via router composition root, operations decoupled from database) is faithfully preserved.
